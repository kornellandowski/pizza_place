# Pizza_Place (PostgreSQL, Tableau)
# Project Overview:
This project is contains designing and building a SQL database, writing custom SQL queries, and connecting the database to a Business Intelligence (BI) tool for creating interactive dashboards. 
The project is designed to demonstrate key skills necessary for SQL-related roles, including database design, data normalization, query writing, and data visualization.

## Section 1: Database Design
**Objective:** To design and build a tailor-made relational database for a pizzeria business, focusing on key areas such as customer orders, stock levels, and staff management.
Tasks:<br>
**Client Brief:** Design a database for capturing and storing business data, helping the client monitor performance through dashboards.<br>
**Database Structure:**<br>
**Customer Orders:** Designing an orders table, normalizing data, and creating relationships between orders, customers, and delivery addresses.
Stock Levels: Creating tables for ingredients and stock levels to track inventory and assist in stock management.
Staff Management: Developing tables for staff details, work shifts, and staff rotas to monitor labor costs.<br>
**Tools:** Quick Database Diagrams (Quick DBD) for database modeling.

## Section 2: SQL Query Writing
**Objective:** To write custom SQL queries to extract and manipulate data from the designed database to fulfill specific business needs.<br>
**Tasks:** <br>
**Order Data Queries:**
Extracting total orders, total sales, average order value, and sales by product category.
Writing complex joins to combine data from multiple tables.
Inventory Management Queries:
Calculating ingredient costs, tracking stock levels, and identifying items that need reordering.
Staff Management Queries:
Calculating total staff costs, hours worked, and labor costs per pizza order.<br>
**Key Concepts:** Data aggregation, CTE, data joins, and calculated fields.<br>
## Section 3: BI Tool Integration and Dashboard Creation
**Objective:** To connect the SQL database to a BI tool and create dashboards that visualize the data and provide actionable insights.<br>
**Tasks:<br>**
**BI Tool Setup:**
Configure data source schemas and define data types.
**Dashboard Development:** <br>
**Orders Dashboard:** Visualizations for total orders, sales, items sold, and sales distribution by category and time.
Inventory Dashboard: Tables and charts displaying stock levels, ingredient costs, and reorder status. <br>
**Staff Dashboard:** Metrics and tables showing staff costs, hours worked, and staff contributions to order fulfillment. <br>
**Design Considerations:**
Effective use of space, color, and visual hierarchy.
Simplified visualization for ease of understanding.
Conditional formatting to highlight critical data points.
## Conclusion:
This project provides a practical demonstration of end-to-end data handling and visualization, from database design and SQL querying to dashboard creation in a BI tool.
